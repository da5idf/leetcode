Angular vs. React vs. Vue

Library vs. framework
    Libary - collection of reusable code to solve problems
    Framework - have opinions, application structure, app startup, component interaction
    Both speed up the development process

Thinking about the DOM or Virtual DOM
    In a traditional DOM, the DOM tree will find every node interested in an event and update it. This results in a computationally heavy process that requires analyzing and updating an entire tree structure at every change of state.

    A Virtual DOM (React) creates a Virtual Tree. As a result, the Virtual DOM can calculate how the DOM should look as state changes without recreating all of the DOM nodes.
        Advantages:
            Updating the DOM is quicker
            JSX is more readable
            Data binding allows for more dynamic web and mobile applications (React Native)
            Prompt rendering-- Virtual DOMs minimize the number of operations and accelerate the process of upadating single-page information in real-time.

Data binding 
    Angular uses bi-directional
    React uses uni-directional

Angular (Framework)
    By Google
    Oldest of the three
    High learning curve
        Directives, Modules, Decorators, Components, Services,
        Dependency Injection, Pipes, Templates... lots of overhead

React (Library)
    By Facebook
    Building interactive user-interfaces
    Most popular of the three

Vue (framework)
    Ex-google employees
    About as easy to learn as React

Stability 
    React community is averse to pushing huge updates that depricate
    old APIs. In contrast, Angular has bi-anual updates which makes you
    need to update your APIs at least every year.

Think about tech talent
    Angular is losing popularity, React is super popular so finding 
    talent is maybe eaiser with React or even Vue

Size
    Angular is 2x as big as React and Vue
