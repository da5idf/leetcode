/*
You have n bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to n. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. We turn on exactly one bulb every day until all bulbs are on after n days.

You are given an array bulbs of length n where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.

Given an integer k, return the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly k bulbs between them that are all turned off. If there isn't such day, return -1.

bulbs = [1,3,2], k = 1

bulbs = [1,2,3], k = 1
